# Object Tracking for the Metaverse

The idea behind this project is to map real objects into a virtual scene, in order to create a virtual reality environment, where the player can perceive an object through their headset and grab it with the feeling of touching it physically. This can have multiple uses in various fields ranging from medical use to didactic. 

We choose a simple object to track, and developed different approaches for tracking, with a specific focus on delay and accuracy since these two aspects are fundamental for immersion in the virtual environment and for the interactions. 

In order to have a simple object of a given size, we opted to 3D print a cube, which allowed us to precisely set our dimensions.

The task was divided into different approaches: first with a Motion Capture system by Optitrack and then, using a camera or a stereo camera to try to get the same information.
